            An Annual Filling is a mandatory filing to be made by the company incorporated in India. The E-form filing along with the required documents must be filed with MCA.
            <br>
            All companies registered in India like private limited company, one person company, limited company, and section 8 company must file MCA annual return and income tax return each year. Companies must conduct an Annual General Meeting at the end of each financial year and file an annual return with the Ministry of Corporate Affair to maintain compliance.
            <br>
            For newly incorporated Companies, the Annual General Meeting should be held within 18 months from date of incorporation or 9 months from the date of closing of financial year, whichever is earlier. Subsequent Annual General Meetings should be held within 6 months from the end of that financial year. In India, normally the financial year starts on April 1st and end on 31st March. So a Companyâ€™s annual return would be due on or before September 30th.
