                <h3>The reasons why you need a patent:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Incentives: Primitive incentives incorporated in the patent system include incentives to invent in the first place; to invest the sums necessary to research and to update and improve upon earlier patents.</li>

                    <li>Protection: Patents are meant to promote and encourage disclosure of innovations into the public domain for their welfare. Patents generally makes the aspects of an invention publicly available, for exploitation by anyone after the patent expires, or for further development by other inventors. Furthermore, when a patent's term has expired, the public record assures that the patentee's invention is not lost to humanity.</li>
