            If an NGO has 12-A registration then its income is exempted. Also if an organization is registered under section 80-G of Income-tax act then the donors of that NGO can claim exemption from income tax. There are certain conditions for these registrations like the NGO should not be related to religion or caste support groups. The registration of 12-A and 80-G helps in attracting potential donors. This act also helps in government funding which is also a major boost in the growth of the organization.
