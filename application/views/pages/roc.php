            Some of the merits for regular ROC compliance are:
        </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Saves Penalty :</b> To avoid heavy penalties which can be as high as 12 times the normal fee, filling of forms regular compliances is necessary.</li>
                    <li><b>Safe from strike off:</b> If any company fails to register under the act of regular compliances for 3 years in a row then a heavy fine will be imposed and the process of restoration or activation of the company name can cost lakhs.</li>
                    <li><b>Maintaining company status active:</b> From taking finance loans to tenders and having third-party inspections, ROC helps the company in maintaining active status.</li>
                </ul>
