            Filing Income tax returns is the duty of every citizen and it is to be fulfilled every year to the Income-tax department. Filing an ITR is not a job every person can do on its own. They need a sound knowledge of accounts and law. And if not properly handled, fines can be imposed on the individual for various reasons like fraud, late fees, etc. by the income tax department.
