            Apart from sole proprietorship we also have another form of business organization called a partnership. Sometimes when the business grows and it becomes extremely complex for the entrepreneur to handle the firm, he looks for a partnership form of the business. This fulfills his requisite capital and resources and also helps in the supervision and control of the work. The proprietorship also helps the division of work and the risk is also shared thereby reducing the burden.
