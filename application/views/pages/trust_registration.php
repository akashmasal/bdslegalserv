        <p>Trust registration has become a complex process needing expert guidance and the legal document on which the registration of trust is signed is called a trust deed. Trust deed must be executed on an appropriate non-judicial stamp paper. Two types of trust are present and they are as follows:</p>
        <p>
            <b>1. Public trust:</b>
            <br>
            A charitable trust or public trust is created by keeping the general public in mind.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>2. Private trust:</b>
            <br>
            When a particular group of individuals signs a trust deed for their benefits then it is called private trust.
