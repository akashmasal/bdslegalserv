            A partnership which gives limited liabilities to some or all partners depending on the jurisdiction is called Limited Liability partnership (LLP). If one or more of the partner misconducts then the others are not responsible for his/her acts. LLP is also called a hybrid between the company and the partnership.

                                        An LLP must be registered under the LLP Act to operate its business. However, the registration of
                                        a partnership firm is voluntary under the Partnership Act, 1932. The liability of each partner is
                                        limited to the contribution made by the partner in an LLP. But in a partnership firm, all partners
                                        are personally liable for the loss/debts of the firm.
                                        The LLP has a separate legal entity, i.e. it can buy property, sue and be sued in its name.
                                        Partnership firms cannot buy a property or sue anyone in the partnership firm’s name. It has to
                                        be in the name of the authorised partner as the partnership firm does not have a separate legal
                                        entity.

                                        No, the Memorandum of Association (MOA) and the Articles of Association (AOA) are important
                                        documents of a company registered under the Companies Act, 2013. The LLP agreement governs
                                        the LLP and not the MOA and AOA. Thus, an LLP does not have to draft the MOA and AOA. It has
                                        to draft the LLP agreement.

                                        No, there are no directors in an LLP. An LLP does not have to appoint directors or have a board of
                                        directors. The partners govern the business of an LLP. The partners take decisions regarding the
                                        working and business of the LLP. Thus, an LLP needs to have a minimum of two partners at all
                                        times.

                                        Designated Partner Identification Number (DPIN) is a unique number given by the MCA to the
                                        designated partner of an LLP. The DPIN is similar to the Director Identification Number (DIN) of a
                                        company director. DPIN can be obtained for any person when registering an LLP, or a person can
                                        later apply for a DPIN to become a designated partner of an existing LLP.
